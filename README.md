# Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic tic tac toe game in python with stoopidAI(just plays random moves lol)

# How to play(why would u though)
download the main.py file place whereever you want and copy the file path and open powershell(or any other terminal)

`cd YOUR PATH`
make sure to replace YOUR PATH with the file path you copied earlier and run:

`python main.py`
or if this doesnt work use:

`python3 main.py`
